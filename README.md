## About

I aways liked macOS style system because of how clean and compact it is. So after discovering [APC extension by drcika](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drcika.apc-extension) I decided started tweaking my VSCode to be more compact and this is the result.

## Extensions Included

- [APC](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drcika.apc-extension)
- [Carbon Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.icons-carbon)
- [Symbols](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.symbols)
- [MonoDracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=diego-ferreira.monodracula)

## Installation

1. Install this extension pack or install the extensions included in this pack individually. (You may need to exit VSCode and reopen it as administrator)
    > **The only mandatory extension is APC.**
2. Add [this settings](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/euaaron/85b5833117a90be8e33b8d1726ca78f0/raw/fe84206686d61db0430be74382b27e95f732a49a/settings.json) to your VSCode User Settings.
    > If you don't know how to do it, just press `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `F1` and type `user settings`.
3. Restart VSCode (no need for admin rights now).
